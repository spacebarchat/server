Welcome to Spacebar, if you've made it here, I'm guessing you're looking to contribute.

A good place to start would be over at the issues tab, though https://docs.spacebar.chat/contributing/server/missingroute/
may also be a good indicator for things that are remaining.

If you find yourself working on something, or want to discuss particular issues, feel free to drop by our developers guild (<a href="https://fermi.chat/invite/VOzfQE?instance=spacebar.chat">

Keep in mind that we do, under no circumstances, accept AI-generated, AI-assisted, or otherwise machine-generated contributions, for legal reasons.
